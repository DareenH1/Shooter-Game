First Branch was created by Dareen. Dareen uploaded original game file created through lecture. In charge of Task 2, therefore created a cylinder EnemyTwo that moved in the opposite direction of EnemyOne in random positions that also started a couple of seconds later than EnemyOne.
Second Branch was created by Olivia. In charge of Task 1, therefore allowed the player to move ONLY at the bottom half of the screen. Player does not move below the bottom line of the screen and above the middle of the screen.
